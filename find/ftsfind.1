.TH FTSFIND 1 \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
ftsfind \- search for files in a directory hierarchy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ftsfind
[\-H] [\-L] [\-P] [\-D debugopts] [\-Olevel] [path...] [expression]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ftsfind
and
.B find
programs are functionally identical.  The only difference between them
is the implementation internals of how the filesystem is searched.
The
.B find
binary has a recursive implementation while
.B ftsfind
uses
.BR fts (3).
The fts-based implementation will replace the recursive implementation
but for the moment both implementations are installed.
.P
The implementation which is installed as
.B find
on this system is the recursive implementation, since the
.B \-\-without\-fts
option was passed to the
.B configure
script when findutils was built.
